My Lenovo Tab M10 FHD (TB-X605LC, 2019) was sitting at `status low` on memory before any apps were open. I use it for reading on Moon+Reader. An afternoon with a Debian terminal fixed that.

{{< figure src="/images/notes/android.jpg" alt="Lenovo TB-X605LC showing Magisk installed and memory status normal" >}}

## The Problem

2GB RAM in 2026. Android 9. Google Play Services alone wants 1.2GB at baseline. The lag wasn't slow CPU — it was constant process churn as the OS killed and restarted background apps under memory pressure.

The fix was already baked into the kernel: zRAM — a compressed swap disk that lives entirely in RAM. The driver was compiled in, the block device was present, nothing was switched on. Root was the only thing between that and a usable 1GB of compressed swap.

## Quick Wins Without Root

Before touching the bootloader, a few things that are fully reversible and carry no risk:

- **Cut animation speeds in half** via `adb shell`. The UI immediately feels snappier — this is the single highest-impact change on a slow device.
- **Disable Lenovo bloat** — seven pre-installed packages (OTA updater, wallpaper service, screen assistant, telemetry) that run at boot and serve no purpose on a personal device.
- **Kill location services** — five GPS daemons were running at idle. Turning off location mode dropped them all at once.

These steps together freed roughly 60MB and can be undone with a single command each.

## Rooting

The TB-X605LC is Snapdragon 450, single-partition (A-only). TWRP exists for nearby variants but not this one, so the path was Magisk on top of a stock boot image.

The bootloader unlock has a quirk on this firmware: the Developer Options toggle for OEM unlocking doesn't persist. It has to be forced via `adb shell` before rebooting into fastboot. And where most modern devices use `fastboot flashing unlock`, this one requires `fastboot oem unlock-go` — a wipe-and-unlock command that the standard unlock path explicitly tells you to use instead.

Getting a boot image without root meant pulling stock firmware (`S000100`, one minor version ahead of what was running), extracting `boot.img`, feeding it through Magisk's "Select and Patch a File" on the tablet itself, and pulling the patched image back over ADB. Flash it, reboot, done.

## zRAM

Lenovo had already configured zRAM at 1GB in the kernel. Root confirmed it was there and mounted — the OS just wasn't calling `swapon`. A small Magisk boot script fixed that permanently.

## Result

Before:
```
Total RAM: 1,880,248K  (status low)
```

After:
```
Total RAM: 1,880,248K  (status normal)
```

`status normal` means Android is no longer in crisis mode. It's the same hardware — the OS is just no longer thrashing under memory pressure every time a background process stirs.

Boot time is still ~2 minutes. That's hardware init — the touchscreen firmware sequencing alone accounts for most of it. Not worth chasing.

## WiFi Recovery via EDL Reflash

Six months later the WiFi toggle greyed out entirely — unresponsive on the screen and via ADB. Known issue on the TB-X605LC with Android 9: the WiFi driver stack corrupts silently, often after an OTA or hard reset cycle. Bluetooth still worked, which confirmed the hardware (Qualcomm WCN3620 combo chip) was fine.

Software fixes exhausted in order: ADB wifi toggle, airplane mode cycle, wpa_supplicant restart, wiping `/data/misc/wifi/*`, network settings reset. None of them brought the toggle back.

The fix was a full stock firmware reflash via Qualcomm EDL (Emergency Download) mode — the same protocol used on the factory floor.

Since the bootloader was already unlocked and the device was rooted, entering EDL was one command:

```bash
adb reboot edl
```

The device re-enumerates as `05c6:9008` (Qualcomm QDL). From there, the `edl` Python tool handles the rest on Linux — no Windows required, no QPST/QFIL.

The firmware package from firmwarefile.com is a QDL bundle: a firehose programmer (`prog_emmc_firehose_8953_ddr.mbn`), a partition layout XML (`rawprogram_unsparse.xml`), a patch XML (`patch0.xml`), and all partition images split into chunks. The edl tool streams them to the device over USB at ~28 MB/s.

One command flashes the full eMMC:

```bash
python3 edl.py qfil rawprogram_unsparse.xml patch0.xml . --loader=prog_emmc_firehose_8953_ddr.mbn
```

Device reboots into stock Android 9. WiFi toggle immediately responsive. Magisk was gone (boot partition overwritten) but reinstalling it took ten minutes following the same path as before.

Total time from greyed-out WiFi to working: about an hour, most of it downloading the 2.4 GB firmware package.

## Annexure — Commands

### No-root tweaks (run inside `adb shell`)

```bash
# Animation scaling
settings put global animator_duration_scale 0.5
settings put global window_animation_scale 0.5
settings put global transition_animation_scale 0.5

# Disable Lenovo bloat
pm disable-user --user 0 com.lenovo.ocpl
pm disable-user --user 0 com.lenovo.dsa
pm disable-user --user 0 com.lenovo.ota
pm disable-user --user 0 com.tblenovo.whatsnewclient
pm disable-user --user 0 com.tblenovo.whatsnewhost

# Kill location
settings put secure location_mode 0
```

### Bootloader unlock

```bash
adb shell settings put global oem_unlock_allowed 1
adb reboot bootloader

fastboot oem unlock-go        # wipes the device
# Note: fastboot flashing unlock fails — use oem unlock-go
```

### Patch and flash boot image

```bash
# Push stock boot.img to tablet, patch via Magisk app, pull back
adb push ~/boot.img /sdcard/boot.img
adb pull /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched-*.img ~/magisk_patched.img

# Flash
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot flash --disable-verity --disable-verification vbmeta ~/vbmeta.img
fastboot flash boot ~/magisk_patched.img
fastboot reboot

# Verify
adb shell su -c "whoami"      # root
```

### zRAM boot script

```bash
# Heredoc ! trips up bash history expansion — use a temp file
cat > /tmp/zram.sh << 'SCRIPT'
#!/system/bin/sh
swapon /dev/block/zram0
SCRIPT

adb push /tmp/zram.sh /sdcard/zram.sh
adb shell su -c "cp /sdcard/zram.sh /data/adb/post-fs-data.d/zram.sh"

### Post-reflash cleanup

After the reflash, Magisk was reinstalled (boot partition overwritten by EDL flash), then the full bloat removal pass was run again. Additional apps removed beyond the original list:

```bash
# Google
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.google.android.apps.tachyon"     # Duo
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox"  # Assistant
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.google.android.apps.wellbeing"   # Digital Wellbeing

# Microsoft
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.microsoft.office.outlook"

# Skype
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.skype.raider"

# Factory/diagnostic tools
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.yha.factory"
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.qualcomm.qti.qmmi"

# Logging and telemetry
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.log.logservice"
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.log.setlog"
adb shell su -c "pm uninstall --user 0 com.qualcomm.qti.qms.service.telemetry"

# Security hardening
adb shell settings put global send_action_app_error 0
adb shell settings put secure send_action_app_error 0
```

Apps installed via ADB: Magisk, AdAway (root hosts blocking), NewPipe, Termux. F-Droid handles the rest.

**Tools:** Debian Linux, `android-tools-adb`, `android-tools-fastboot`, Magisk v30.7, stock firmware from firmwarefile.com, `bkerler/edl` Python tool.
