### Two big ideas here
- Idea#1: Use an LLM, to create something, anything
- Idea#2: Do it for a 100 days
- A third, meta idea, is to write about what I've done (aside: why is this a meta-idea, will write about it later)

### Today's vibe-coding idea: create a browser extension for a URL sanitizer.

It removes all tracking parameters from the link before rendering it in a new tab.
Tool of choice: Gemini - got this idea from [S Ananand's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJLNML7FrE)

What struck me as amazing, was the ease of creating and how close the outcome was, to what I'd expected.
And what was also equally amazing, was that it worked. I also got the LLM to create an icon and name it.


### Some Caveats
- I'm not sure, how effective the URL sanitization actually is. 
- Also, there are tons of similar addons, so what makes PureLink any better / different / good ?
- Need to spend some more time validating the results, but I was happy with the initial outcomes and will eventually do a bit more study and analysis of the inner working of the code.

### Additional Reading Required
- [CleanURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon) has more on the subject, which I intend re-visiting, at some point in time.
- PureLink Browser Addon Github repo [here](https://github.com/mr-dinesh/Vibecoding001-PureLink_browser_addon)


### Work to be done
- Improve the code
- Create a Readme, to remind myself what has been done, and what needs to be.
