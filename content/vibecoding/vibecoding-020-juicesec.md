OWASP Juice Shop is the gold standard for learning web application security — a deliberately vulnerable Node.js app where you practice exploiting real vulnerabilities in a safe environment. I wanted to build something with the same spirit but without the setup: no Docker, no Node, no local install. Open a URL, start hacking.

The result is JuiceSec: ten interactive challenges covering the OWASP Top 10, with an AI tutor that coaches you through each one using the Socratic method.

## The challenges

All ten run entirely in the browser — there's no real backend to attack, but the simulations are faithful enough to teach the actual mechanics:

| # | Challenge | OWASP 2021 |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | SQL Injection | A03 — Injection |
| 02 | Reflected XSS | A03 — Injection |
| 03 | Broken Authentication | A07 — Auth Failures |
| 04 | IDOR | A01 — Broken Access Control |
| 05 | Security Misconfiguration | A05 — Misconfiguration |
| 06 | Sensitive Data Exposure | A02 — Cryptographic Failures |
| 07 | JWT None Algorithm | A02 — Cryptographic Failures |
| 08 | Command Injection | A03 — Injection |
| 09 | SSRF | A10 — SSRF |
| 10 | Stored XSS | A03 — Injection |

The SQL injection challenge shows the query being constructed in real time as you type — you can watch exactly what happens to the `WHERE` clause when you inject `' OR '1'='1`. The JWT challenge gives you a live token decoder and encoder, so you can swap `alg: HS256` for `alg: none` and escalate your role from user to admin. The SSRF challenge accepts any URL and shows what the server "fetches" — point it at `169.254.169.254` and watch it hand over AWS IAM credentials.

Each challenge is solved, not explained. You have to find the exploit yourself.

## The AI tutor

The right panel is a chat interface backed by Cloudflare Workers AI (`llama-3.1-8b-instruct`). It has two modes:

**Hint mode** — Socratic. It never gives you the answer. Instead it asks questions that push you toward the right mental model: *"What do you think happens to the SQL query if your input contains a single quote?"* It's genuinely annoying in the best way.

**Explain mode** — fires automatically when you solve a challenge. It explains the root cause, gives a real-world example of the vulnerability being exploited, and describes the correct mitigation. This is the part that makes it educational rather than just a game.

The system prompt is strict: the tutor is forbidden from revealing the exploit string until the challenge is solved. I tested this and it holds — even when you ask directly, it redirects to a guiding question.

## Architecture

Same pattern as [argus](/vibecoding/vibecoding-016-argus) — a single Cloudflare Worker that serves the full app at `GET /` and handles the AI tutor at `POST /tutor`. No external API keys. No database. No build step.

```
GET  /        → full HTML/CSS/JS app (inlined)
POST /tutor   → Workers AI (llama-3.1-8b-instruct)
```

The challenge logic runs entirely in browser JavaScript. A simulated `ORDER_DB` object backs the IDOR challenge. A `commentStore` array backs the stored XSS comment board. The JWT challenge uses `btoa`/`atob` in the browser to encode and decode tokens. None of this is real — but the vulnerability patterns are.

One thing that bit me: all the challenge JavaScript lives inside a template literal (`const HTML = \`...\``) in the worker. JavaScript template literals silently strip backslashes from unrecognised escape sequences — so every regex using `\w`, `\s`, `\S`, `\b` in the challenge code was broken at runtime. `/on\w+=/` was arriving in the browser as `/onw+=/`. Fixed by doubling every backslash in the template: `\\w`, `\\s`, etc. The kind of bug that only shows up when you're testing the live app.
