### What's Mankutimmana Kagga

Mankutimmana Kagga — often called the Kannada Gita — is a collection of 945 philosophical verses by D.V. Gundappa (DVG). Written in the 1940s, it wrestles with life's biggest questions with a rare combination of humility and depth. It deserves a wider audience.

### KaggaBot

It's a small automation that does one simple thing: post two verses from the Kagga every day to Mastodon (an ad-free social media platform), automatically, without anyone pressing a button.

### What's in the code

The core of the bot is a Python file containing all the verses of the Kagga, individually scraped and stored as structured data. 

A script picks from this collection and formats each verse for posting. GitHub Actions handles the scheduling — no server required, no ongoing cost.

Verses in .py file  →  bot script  →  GitHub Actions cron  →  Mastodon post

### The scheduling magic

A GitHub Actions workflow file defines two daily triggers — morning and evening. When the schedule fires, GitHub spins up a clean environment, checks out the code, and runs the bot. That's the entire pipeline. No cloud bill. No server to maintain. No babysitting.

### Why Mastodon?
Mastodon is open, ad-free, and has a clean API — ideal for a bot that exists purely to share literature, not to game an algorithm. The posts are public and readable by anyone, no account needed.

### What Broke

**GitHub Actions cron doesn't mean "exactly at this time."** The workflow is scheduled for 6am and 6pm, but GitHub runs scheduled workflows when capacity is available — which during busy periods can mean a delay of 15–30 minutes. For a poetry bot, that's fine. For anything time-sensitive, it would be a problem worth knowing about upfront.

**The ephemeral environment forgets everything.** GitHub Actions spins up a clean runner for each job. There's no persistent file system between runs. This matters for state tracking — knowing which verse was posted last. The solution is committing the current verse index back to the repository after each run. If you forget this, the bot picks a verse randomly (or always posts verse #1) on every run. First version did exactly that.

**GitHub disables scheduled workflows on inactive repos.** If a repository has no activity for 60 days, GitHub automatically disables scheduled workflows. The bot will simply stop posting with no notification. The fix is either a periodic commit to keep the repo active, or enabling the workflow manually when it gets disabled. Worth knowing before you rely on it as a daily habit.

**The Mastodon API token in GitHub Secrets.** Storing the token as a repository secret works, but if the secret is misconfigured (wrong variable name in the workflow YAML) the bot fails silently — no post, no obvious error in the logs unless you know to look at the environment variable step. Naming the secret `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` and double-checking the `${{ secrets.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN }}` reference in the YAML saved a lot of confusion.

### Why this matters
At two posts a day, it takes over a year to work through all 945 verses of Mankutimmana Kagga.

That's the right pace for philosophy — slow enough to sit with, regular enough to build a habit. KaggaBot transforms reading a classic Kannada text into a daily practice, entirely on autopilot.

The whole project is open source. If you want to adapt it — for a different text, a different language, a different platform — the bones are all there.
